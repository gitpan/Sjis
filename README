      use Sjis version qw(ord reverse);

    And on command prompt:
      perl     ShiftJIS_script.pl  wild*  *card  and  '*quote*'  are  ok  ...
      perl58   ShiftJIS_script.pl  wild*  *card  and  '*quote*'  are  ok  ...

DESCRIPTION

      This software is "Yet Another JPerl" written by Perl.
      We can treat ShiftJIS by the CSI(Character Set Independent) method.
      So we can write Perl scripts in ShiftJIS, without UTF8 flag, again.

      This "JPerl" means "Japanized Perl" or "Japanese Perl".
      So is unrelated to Mr. Patrick E. Martin's JPerl -- Perl 5 implemented in Java.
      And is unrelated to Mr. Ben Evans's jPerl -- Perl on the JVM, too.

      This software is a beta3 version for final public comment.
