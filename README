DESCRIPTION

      This software is "Yet Another JPerl with Tk" written by Perl.
      We can write the Perl/Tk script in ShiftJIS again.

      This "JPerl" is Japanized or Japanese Perl.
      So is unrelated to Mr. Patrick E. Martin's JPerl -- Perl 5 implemented in Java.
      And is unrelated to Mr. Ben Evans's jPerl -- Perl on the JVM, too.

      This software is a beta2 version for the public comment.
